# Phase_4_Project
Welcome to my Phase 4 Project from Flatiron School.

This project will focus on time series data. Specifically, Zillow real estate data. 
The business problem:
A high-end real estate firm is looking to invest in PA. I'm tasked with finding 5 zip codes worth investing in, as well as modeling the potential growth of the investment.
The data is nationwide, so the first step will be to filter it to just Pennsylvania. Then convert it to long form from wide. Then plotting it to see the zip codes with the best growth. Then on to the modeling.
I'll be using code from the school (specifically given to us for this project), from the workbooks, as well as from Facebook's Prophet documentation.
I'll be setting up a simple baseline model using linear regression, then move on to Auto ARIMA, then finally Prophet.
This repository will contain the non-technical powerpoint presentation (and pdf of same), as well as the jupyter notebooks of starter code (provided by the school) and the notebook I have used to complete the project.
